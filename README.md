You will have a span of 24 hours to complete this test from the time of me sending this email.
Please follow these steps to code a small static site from one of our prototypes:

Get a new project set up with Zurb Foundation 6 for Sites. Please match the attached prototype as closely
as possible within reason. I've attached both a PNG and the working Sketch file.

The typefaces used are Proxima Nova and Proxima Nova Condensed. You can use the following Typekit
embed code to load in the fonts:
  <script src="https://use.typekit.net/qlu7ssd.js"></script>
  <script>try{Typekit.load({ async: true });}catch(e){}</script>

Font Awesome was used for the icons

Please upload the Github project and send me the link to the project when you are finished.
